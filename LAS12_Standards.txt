ABSTRACT

The Canadian Well Logging Society's Floppy Disk Committee has designed a
standard  format for log data on floppy disks. It is known as the LAS
format (Log ASCII Standard). LAS consists of files written in ASCII
containing minimal header information and is intended for optical curves
only.  Details of the LAS format are described in this paper.

The purpose of the LAS format is to supply basic digital log data
to users of personal computers in a format that is quick and easy to use.

INTRODUCTION

Log analysts who use personal computers have, in the past, been entering
log data into their machines mainly through a hand digitizing procedure
because most personal computers are unable to handle data from magnetic tapes.
The industry was beginning to address this inefficiency by making log data
available on floppy disks in a variety of formats.  It was at this point
that the Canadian Well Logging Society set up the Floppy Disk Committee to
design a standard for log data on floppy disks that would meet the needs of
personal computer users.

Various standards for digital well log data already exist.  The LIS format
(Log Information Standard) is one of the more popular standards. A more
complete standard is presently being prepared by the American Petroleum
Institute which is known as the DLIS format (Digital Log Interchange
Standard).  Both of these standards are very useful but because of their
completeness, and resulting complexity, they do not address the needs of most
personal computer users.

Users of personal computers have serious space limitations and are normally
only interested in the optically presented curves. They also want to get this
data into their machines quickly and easily. The LAS format addresses these
needs and can be compared to a "Reader's Digest" version of the LIS or DLIS
formats.  If more detailed log information is required, then the LIS or DLIS
format should be used.  The LAS format is intended to complement the LIS or
DLIS formats as each has its own specific purpose.




GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The LAS format was designed to be easily understood by the user and at the
same time contain enough flags to assist the programmer. The LAS format must
always be written in ASCII. If it is written using a compression routine, in
binary, or in any other form, an executable program must exist on the floppy
disk that will convert the file back to LAS format.

The LAS format consists of files. For example, a repeat section would make
up one file and the main pass another. Each of the file names end in ".LAS"
so that they can be easily recognized. An individual floppy disk must not
contain partial files that continue onto a second floppy disk.  Large files
that do not fit on one floppy must be split into two or more files.

Each file consists of numerous sections. These sections are not order
specific except that the last section must always be the data section. The
first section is usually the "VERSION" section containing the version number
of the LAS format and identifies whether the data is in wrap mode.  The "WELL
INFORMATION" section contains information on the well name, location, and the
start and stop depths of the data in this file.  The "CURVE INFORMATION"
section contains the curve mnemonics, units used, and the definitions of these
mnemonics, in the order that they appear in the data section.  The "PARAMETER"
section contains informat on parameters or constants (such as mud
resistivities) and is optional.  The "OTHER" section is also optional and
contains any other information or comments.  The last section is always the
"ASCII LOG DATA" section.  Depth values should appear in the first column
and each column of data must be separated by a space.

More detailed LAS format specifications can be found in the Appendix.


REFORMAT AND CERTIFY PROGRAMS

To assist users of LAS formatted data, a program was written to modify
LAS files into forms that may be more compatible to the user's needs. The
program is called REFORMAT and can perform the following tasks:

     1) Extract a specific depth interval

     2) Extract specific curves

     3) Reverse depth direction

     4) Change sampling interval

     5) Convert wrap mode to unwrap mode

     6) Scan for non-standard characters which may be causing
	difficulties for some programs.

The CERTIFY program was designed to verify that files meet the LAS standard.
If the LAS standards are not met, it will identify the errors.  In case of
disagreement between this program and the printed LAS standard document, the
document will be deemed to be correct.  The CERTIFY program also includes
documentation on the LAS standard.

The REFORMAT  and CERTIFY programs were written by Robin Winsor of Gulf
Canada Resources Ltd. in ANSI standard "C" and compiled with a Microsoft C 5.1
compiler.  These programs are not part of the LAS standard.

The author of these programs does not reserve any rights and does not
warrant the program for any specific purpose.  An LAS information package is
available for $10.00 through the C.W.L.S.  The package includes an executable
form of the REFORMAT and CERTIFY programs, source code for REFORMAT, and two
test LAS files on a 3.5 inch 720K DOS compatible floppy disk.

CONCLUSIONS

The latest release of the LAS format is version 1.2 which was released in
August of 1989.  The CWLS Floppy Disk Committee will monitor the LAS format
to address problems and make modifications to the standard as required.
Feedback concerning the user's likes or dislikes would be greatly appreciated
and should be sent to the CWLS to the attention of the Floppy Disk Committee.

It is hoped that by creating the LAS format, more widespread use will be made
of digital log data.


APPENDIX

LAS FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS FOR VERSION 1.2


PART 1	GENERAL DESCRIPTION


The LAS Format is designed to store log data on floppy disks. This standard
is intended to simplify the exchange of digital log data between users. The
general specifications of this format are as follows:

1)  The floppy disk size, type, or density is not specified because
    conversion between them is straightforward.

2)  It is the intent of this standard to store optically presented log
    curves although other curves may also be stored. Raw count rates, wave
    form data etc. are more efficiently stored on magnetic tape using LIS
    or DLIS format.

3)  Floppy disks in the LAS format must be MS/DOS or PC/DOS compatible

4)  The file will be written in ASCII.  If the file is written using a
    compression method, in binary, or in any other form, an executable
    program  must  exist on the floppy to convert it back to LAS format.

5)  An individual floppy disk must not contain partial files that continue
    onto a second floppy. Large files that do not fit onto one floppy must be
    split into two or more separate files.  This may be achieved by splitting
    the curves or segmenting the depths.

6)  All files in LAS format must end in ".LAS" so that they may be easily
    recognized.

7)  The LAS format is a minimum standard. It is expected that most users and
    suppliers will exceed this minimum standard.


PART 2  MAJOR COMPONENTS OF AN LAS FILE

Each LAS file contains numerous sections and each section begins with a
tilde (~) mark. The last section in an LAS file must always be the log data
section.

The sections that make up an LAS file are as follows:

	~V	- contains version and wrap mode information
	~W	- contains well identification
	~C	- contains curve information
	~P	- contains parameters or constants
	~O	- contains other information such as comments
	~A	- contains ASCII log data

These sections are described in more detail in part four of this appendix.


PART 3	FLAGS

Flags are used to assist computers in identifying specific lines in a file.
The following flags are used in the LAS format:

a)      "~" (tilde): The ASCII equivalent of this flag is decimal 126
	or hexadecimal 7E. This flag when used will be the first non-space
	and non-quotation character on a line. It is used to mark the
	beginning of a section in a file. The first letter directly after the
	tilde identifies the section. (See part two.)  All upper case letters
	in the space following a tilde mark are reserved for use by the
	committee.  The remainder of the line will be treated as comments.

b)      "#" (pound): The ASCII equivalent of this flag is decimal 35 or
	 hexadecimal 23. This flag when used will be the first non-space and
	 non-quotation character on a line. The Pound sign is used to indicate
	 that the line is a comment line. Comment lines can appear anywhere
	 above the data section.

c)      "." and ":" : In sections other than the data section, dots and
	colons are used to delimit information within the line.  They are
	usually aligned for ease of reading. Information to the right of the
	colon is a detailed definition of the mnemonic that is located to the
	left of the colon.  The dot is used to separate two mnemonics.  Spaces
	may occur to the right or left of a dot or colon.


PART 4 	DETAILS

The actual format for each of the sections discussed in this part of the
paper is best understood by looking at the examples in the boxed areas. The
exact spacing is not critical because computer programs will use the dots,
colons and spaces to decipher each line.

I)	~V (Version Information)

-This section is mandatory and usually appears at the very beginning of the
 file.

-It identifies which version of the LAS format is being used and whether
 wrap mode is used.

-This section must contain the following lines:

"VERS.  1.2: CWLS LOG ASCII STANDARD - VERSION 1.2"
	Refers to which version of LAS was used.

"WRAP.	YES: Multiple lines per depth step"
OR 
"WRAP.	NO:  One line per depth step"
	Refers to whether a wrap around mode was used in the data section.
	If no wrap mode is used the line will have a maximum length of 256
	characters (including the carriage return and line feed). If wrap
	mode is used the depth value will be on its own line and all lines
	of data will be no longer than 80 characters (including carriage
	return and line feed).

	-Additional lines in the version section are optional.

The following is an example of a Version Information Section.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~Version Information Section
VERS.             1.2:   CWLS log ASCII Standard -VERSION 1.2
WRAP.               NO:   One line per depth step
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


(II)	~W (Well Information)

    -This section is mandatory.

    -It identifies the well, its location and indicates the start and stop
     depths of the file.

    -This section must contain the following lines with the mnemonics as
     indicated:

"STRT.M			nnn.nn:"
	Refers to the first depth in the file. The "nnn.nn" refers to the
	depth value. The number of decimals used is not restricted. The ".M"
	refers to meters and can be replaced when other units are used. The
	start depth can be either greater or less than the stop depth.

"STOP.M			nnn.nn:"
	Refers to the last depth in the file. The "nnn.nn" refers to the
	depth value. The number of decimals used is not restricted. The ".M"
	refers to meters and can be replaced when other units are used.

"STEP.M			nnn.nn:"
	Refers to the depth increment used. A minus sign must precede the
	step value if the start depth is greater than the stop depth (ie,
	from TD to casing has a minus step value). A step value of zero
	indicates a variable step.

"NULL.			-nnn.nn:"
	Refers to null values.  Two common ones in use are -9999 and -999.25.

"COMP.			COMPANY : "
	Refers to company name.

"WELL.			WELL:"
	Refers to the well name.

"FLD.			FIELD:"
	Refers to the field name.

"LOC.			LOCATION:"
	Refers to the well location.

"PROV.			PROVINCE:"
	Refers to the province. For areas outside Canada this line may be
	replaced by:
"CNTY. 			COUNTY:"
